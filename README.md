Appeal to fear/prejudice
------------------------
Seeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative.
In some cases the support is built based on preconceived judgements.

In simple word : Introducing an idea which can create a sense of anxiety/panic/fear in the reader can be categorized as Appeal-to-authority.

Example 1: "either we go to war or we will perish" 

Example 2: "we must stop those refugees as they are terrorists"

Example 3: If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen.
