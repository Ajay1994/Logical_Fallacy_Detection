Causal_Oversimplification
------------------------

Assuming a single cause or reason when there are actually multiple causes for an issue.
It includes transferring blame to one person or group of people without investigating the complexities of the issue.

Example 1: President Trump has been in office for a month and gas prices have been skyrocketing. The rise in gas prices is because of President Trump.

Example 2: The reason New Orleans was hit so hard with the hurricane was because of all the immoral people who live there.

Example 3: if France had not have declared war on Germany then world war two would have never happened.

Appeal to fear/prejudice
------------------------
Seeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative.
In some cases the support is built based on preconceived judgements.

In simple word : Introducing an idea which can create a sense of anxiety/panic/fear in the reader can be categorized as Appeal-to-authority.

Example 1: "either we go to war or we will perish" 

Example 2: "we must stop those refugees as they are terrorists"

Example 3: If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen.
