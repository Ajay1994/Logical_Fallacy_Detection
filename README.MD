Appeal to fear/prejudice

Seeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative.
In some cases the support is built based on preconceived judgements.

Example 1: "either we go to war or we will perish" (this is also aBlack and White fallacy))
Example 2: "we must stop those refugees as they are terrorists"
